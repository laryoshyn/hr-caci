This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Repository Purpose

This is a strategic research repository analyzing AI's transformative impact on the defense contractor workforce (2025-2028). The research focuses on US defense and government contractors across engineering, IT, consulting, cybersecurity, logistics, and AI/ML sectors supporting military operations.

## Repository Structure

- **RESEARCH.md**: Comprehensive strategic analysis covering 800,000+ defense jobs, organized into three main sections:
  - Category 1: Current job series affected by AI (systems engineers, software developers, cybersecurity analysts, intelligence analysts, logistics coordinators, test engineers, consultants)
  - Category 2: New job series already emerging (2023-2025) (AI ethics officers, prompt engineers, synthetic data engineers, AI model validators, digital twin engineers, AI governance officers)
  - Category 3: Future job series not yet emerging but potentially necessary (2026-2028) (AI constitutional architects, synthetic workforce coordination managers, cross-domain AI integration specialists, quantum-AI integration engineers)

- **DIALOG.md**: Research process log documenting the scope definition, clarifying questions, and research methodology used to produce RESEARCH.md

## Content Architecture

The research follows a hierarchical structure designed for executive consumption:

1. **Executive Summary**: Opens with strategic context including market size ($178 billion defense AI market by 2034), workforce displacement projections (60,000 DoD positions), and critical talent gaps (94% of defense leaders report AI skill shortages)

2. **Job Impact Analysis**: Each role category includes:
   - Displacement risk assessment (low/medium/high)
   - Salary ranges with clearance premiums
   - Required skills and certifications
   - Clearance requirements (Secret, TS, TS/SCI)
   - Market demand projections

3. **Strategic Workforce Planning**: Comprehensive C-suite recommendations including:
   - Build/buy/borrow/partner strategies
   - Retention approaches addressing root causes
   - Organizational transformation priorities (near/mid/long-term)
   - Competitive positioning by contractor type
   - Quantitative workforce sizing and market data

## Key Research Themes

When working with this research, understand these core themes that structure the analysis:

- **Augmentation vs. Replacement**: AI transforms rather than eliminates most defense roles; the research distinguishes between job displacement and job transformation
- **Clearance Constraints**: 80% of defense AI roles require security clearances (Secret to TS/SCI), creating unique talent bottlenecks with 138-140 day processing times
- **Salary Bifurcation**: AI creates widening compensation gaps between AI-enabled roles ($140,000-$240,000+) and legacy positions facing automation
- **Defense-Specific Requirements**: CMMC 2.0 compliance, DoD 8140 certification mandates, and classified network constraints shape workforce needs differently than commercial sectors
- **Talent War Dynamics**: Defense contractors compete against commercial tech firms offering 40-50% higher base compensation, requiring value propositions beyond salary

## Data Sources and Citations

The research synthesizes information from:
- DoD budget documents and policy directives (CDAO, Workforce Acceleration Initiative, Responsible AI Strategy)
- Major contractor workforce data (Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, Booz Allen Hamilton, Raytheon, Leidos)
- Industry reports (McKinsey, AIA, NDIA workforce studies)
- Government workforce projections (BLS, OPM clearance statistics)
- Defense AI program specifics (Project Maven, JADC2, Task Force Lima, Replicator Initiative)

## Writing Style and Tone

The research employs executive business language with these characteristics:
- **Assertive and data-driven**: Opens with definitive claims supported by quantitative evidence
- **Strategic framing**: Positions workforce transformation as existential challenge requiring C-suite action
- **Specificity over generalization**: Provides concrete salary ranges, headcount projections, and timeline estimates
- **Balanced perspective**: Acknowledges both opportunities (new high-value roles) and threats (displacement, talent competition)
- **Action-oriented**: Concludes each section with strategic implications and recommendations

## Common Development Tasks

There are no build, test, or deployment commands for this repository as it contains research documentation rather than executable code.

## Working with the Research

When analyzing or extending this research:
- Maintain the three-category structure (current jobs affected, emerging jobs, future jobs)
- Include specific salary ranges with clearance premiums where applicable
- Distinguish between commercial tech and defense-specific constraints
- Provide emergence timelines for new roles (immediate/2026/2027/2028)
- Ground projections in cited DoD programs, budgets, and contractor initiatives
- Consider both technical skills and clearance/certification requirements
- Address the talent competition dynamic (defense vs. commercial tech)
