workforce planning project/AI's impact on workforce transformationVDo research how AI will change manpower landscape:
1. Current job series and positions affected
2. New job series emerging
3. New job series not emerging and not even exist but potentially be necessaryIdentified research scope and flagged clarifying questions for precision.The user wants me to roleplay as a CEO strategic visionary for a major contractor organization. They want research on how AI will change the manpower landscape across three specific areas:

Current job series and positions affected
New job series emerging
New job series not emerging yet but potentially necessary

They also want both a document-styled answer and a pptx presentation, using business language with visionary futuristic examples.
Since advanced research is enabled, I need to follow the research_instructions. Let me assess if clarifying questions are needed:
The query is fairly specific and detailed. However, there are some potential ambiguities:

"Major contractor organization" - what type of contractor? Government contractor, construction, IT services, defense, etc.?
Time horizon - are we looking at 2025-2030? 2025-2040?
Geographic scope - global, US-focused, specific regions?

These are genuine ambiguities that could significantly affect the research direction. I should ask these questions before launching the research task, but keep them concise and useful - maximum 3 questions.I'll be delighted to conduct this strategic research on AI's transformation of our workforce landscape. Before I dive into comprehensive research, let me clarify a few critical parameters to ensure precision:

Contractor sector focus: Are we examining government/federal contracting, construction/engineering, IT/consulting services, defense contractors, or a specific industry vertical?
Strategic time horizon: What planning window should I target - near-term (2025-2028), mid-term (2025-2030), or long-range strategic (2025-2035+)?
Geographic scope: Should this analysis focus on US workforce dynamics, global trends, or specific regional markets?

These parameters will significantly shape both the workforce categories analyzed and the emerging role architectures we identify.RetryVEngineering, IT, consulting, cyber, logistic, AI/ML2025-2028US and US to support military operationsSynthesized requirements and prepared comprehensive research task launch.The user has provided clear responses to my initial questions:

Sectors: Engineering, IT, consulting, cyber, logistics, AI/ML
Timeframe: 2025-2028 (near-term)
Geographic scope: US and US to support military operations

This is now sufficiently detailed and clear. The user wants both:

A document-styled answer
A PowerPoint presentation

Given the advanced research tool is enabled, I should now launch the extended search task immediately. The query is clear enough that I don't need additional clarifying questions. I should use the launch_extended_search_task tool.
I need to pass a comprehensive, detailed command that captures all the requirements:

AI's impact on manpower landscape
Focus on engineering, IT, consulting, cyber, logistics, AI/ML sectors
Supporting US military operations
Three categories: current jobs affected, new jobs emerging, and jobs not yet conceptualized but potentially necessary
Timeframe: 2025-2028
Need both document and pptx deliverables

Let me craft a thorough command parameter.Perfect - that's the strategic clarity I need. I'll now launch into comprehensive research on AI's transformative impact across your core contractor verticals supporting military operations.AI defense workforce transformation researchResearch complete•651 sources•1h 19mYour AI transformation analysis of the defense contractor workforce is ready. It covers 800,000+ defense jobs through 2028, including current roles facing displacement (systems engineers, cybersecurity analysts, test engineers), emerging positions already in demand (AI ethics officers, prompt engineers, digital twin engineers), and future roles that will become critical by 2026-2028 (AI constitutional architects, synthetic workforce coordinators, quantum-AI integration engineers). The report includes salary ranges, clearance requirements, strategic workforce planning recommendations, and quantitative market projections showing the defense AI market reaching $178 billion by 2034.
